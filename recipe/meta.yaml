  summary: 'Set of compatibility headers for C++ 14, 17, and 20 for C++11'
  description: |
    LibStdCompat is a set of compatibility headers for C++ 14, 17, and
    20 for C++11. It aims to be lighter weight and more narrowly
    tailored than some other alternatives such as Boost or replacing
    your standard library with libcxx when certain fewer features are
    needed.
